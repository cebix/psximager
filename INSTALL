Prerequisites
=============

A C++ compiler.

Boost C++ libraries >= 1.50.0
  http://www.boost.org/

libcdio and libiso9660 >= 0.90
  http://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio/

libvcdinfo >= 0.7.24
  http://www.gnu.org/software/vcdimager/


Installation
============

PSXImager can be compiled and installed in the usual way:

  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  [become root if necessary]
  # make install

Installation is not strictly necessary; the three binaries built in the
"src" directory are stand-alone programs.
