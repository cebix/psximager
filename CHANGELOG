V2.0 (2014-05-10)
 - The syntax of catalog files has changed slightly:
    - File and directory names are no longer enclosed in [] brackets.
    - The start sector of files and directories can optionally be specified
      with "@<lbn>" after the item name.
 - psxrip:
    - The '-l' option now writes the LBNs of files and directories to the
      catalog file instead of a separate LBN file.
    - With the new '-t' option, psxrip prints an LBN table to the screen.
    - Files which have the 'interleaved' flag but not the 'Form 2' flag set
      in their directory record are now dumped as XA files.
 - psxbuild:
    - To create a .cue file along with the image you must now specify the
      '-c' option.
    - At least one sector is allocated for file extents, even for files of
      zero length.
 - psxinject:
    - Injecting XA files is supported.

V1.1 (2014-03-27)
